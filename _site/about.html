<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>

<p>The Processing team establishes and enhances intellectual and physical
control of our archival holdings by efficiently and effectively
organizing, describing, and preserving all eligible materials,
regardless of form, medium or creator, in order to facilitate user
access onsite and online. In working to reduce and ultimately eliminate
the Center’s processing backlog, we ensure timely open and equitable
access to primary sources. We actively promote the use and understanding
of the historical record through the collection guides we create in
accordance with DACS descriptive standards, and all program policies,
practices, and procedures foster accountability and transparency. As we
learn and grow through professional development, we seek opportunities
to contribute to the archival profession and collaborate with
participants in related fields.</p>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Projects are assigned primarily by accession or in small sets of
material.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All archival staff conducting processing should utilize project
management software and create archival description in the RAC
collections management system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Projects focus on priority collections and areas of greatest risk
for degradation and loss including legacy backlog holdings,
audiovisual, digital media, and special formats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Priority is given to those projects for which the RAC has a
contractual obligation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Priority is also given to recent accessions and born-digital
materials when feasible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="processing-levels">Processing Levels</h2>

<p>Processing at RAC is conducted at three levels. Each processing level
builds upon the work accomplished at the previous level. If a given
level of work is not discretely performed, it is incorporated implicitly
into the next higher level.</p>

<p>Level 1: Basic/Preliminary Processing – establishes initial intellectual
  and physical control.</p>

<p>Level 2: Minimal Processing – takes all necessary steps to open records
  for research.</p>

<p>Level 3: Standard Processing – focuses on rehousing and file-level
  description.</p>

<p><em>** Note: All incoming archival materials must complete the accessioning
  process and receive Level 1 and Level 2 Processing in order to be OPEN
  for research. **</em></p>

<h3 id="level-1-basicpreliminary-processing">Level 1: Basic/Preliminary Processing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Basic/Preliminary processing is conducted by the accessioning team,
the processing team, or through interdepartmental teamwork.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All archival ingests receive Level 1 processing at the point of
accessioning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For legacy collections never officially accessioned, the processing
archivist incorporates the necessary steps into the assigned
processing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Head of Processing periodically assigns processing priority to new
accessions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accessions, or portions of collections, with a low processing
priority may require only Level 1 processing for long-term
retention.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Level 1 actions include, but are not necessarily limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Arrangement</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Records remain as received. No arrangement or rearrangement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Box-level instances are assigned.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Description</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Ideally the donor/depositor will provide RAC with an inventory.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the inventory prepared by the donor/depositor adequately
meets basic processing requirements, no additional RAC-produced
inventory is required at accessioning.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>General description of contents from an appraisal report, or
from documents provided by the donor/depositor, can serve in
lieu of an inventory.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The minimum requirement is a single-level general description of
contents, which can also serve in lieu of an inventory.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>General description can be a summary statement describing the
whole such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Accession contains grant files, Board of Directors files,
and subject files.

    <ul>
      <li>

preservation concerns (e.g. mold, water damage, pests,
decomposing items).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Materials are rehoused <em>only</em> when necessary to facilitate
archival storage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Additional preservation or stabilization steps may be taken for
materials with special handling requirements such as oversized, <br />
brittle or damaged items.</p>

<h2 id="processing-project-assignments">Processing Project Assignments</h2>
<p>(<strong>Minimal and Standard Processing</strong>)</p>

<p>Each processing assignment is accomplished in two phases:</p>

<p><a href="planning"><em>Phase I. Planning</em></a></p>

<p><a href="processing"><em>Phase II. Processing</em></a></p>

<p>In an effort to facilitate the work accomplished by processing
  archivists and the interdepartmental teamwork which assists and
  facilitates our success, this processing guide is primarily presented as
  a step-by-step instructional.</p>

<p>The Planning phase consists of eight common steps, and the Processing
  phase consists of 32 common steps. Due to the unique character of each
  individual archival collection and the unforeseen issues that may
  materialize or develop during a project, the ordering of these steps is
  flexible in practice. However <em>ALL</em> 40 steps must be completed, by an
  individual or team, for a collection to be considered successfully
  processed.</p>
