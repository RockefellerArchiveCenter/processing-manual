<h2 id="phase-ii-processing">Phase II: Processing</h2>

<p>The processing phase of each assignment begins with establishing the
current arrangement of the material, evaluating the arrangement needs,
and crafting an arrangement proposal for the project. The proposed
arrangement should then be approved by the Head of Processing and stated
in the Project Vitals.</p>

<p><strong><em>Arrangement</em></strong></p>

<p>Arrangement is the organizing and sequencing of materials in a
collection in a meaningful way. More specifically, it is the process of
ordering materials with respect to <em>provenance</em> and <em>original order</em> to
preserve context and to attain physical and intellectual control of the
holdings.</p>

<p><em>Describing Archives: A Content Standard</em> <em>(DACS)</em> defines the process
of arrangement as: “identifying the logical groupings of materials
within the whole as they were established by the creator, of
constructing a new organization when the original ordering has been
lost, or of establishing an order when one never existed. The archivist
may then identify further subgroupings within each unit down to the
level of granularity that is feasible or desirable. This process creates
hierarchical groupings of material, with each step in the hierarchy
described as a level.” <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/statement_of_principles">(<em>DACS 2013, Principle 3, p.xvii</em>)</a>.</p>

<p>The hierarchical levels commonly used at RAC are: Collection, Record
Group, Subgroup, Series, Subseries, and File.</p>

<p><em>Item-level description is extremely rare, and such detailed description
must be pre-approved by the Head of Processing.</em></p>

<p>The concepts of archival arrangement apply to the organization of all
records regardless of format, including paper collections, audiovisual
collections, digital collections, and “hybrid” collections which consist
of multiple formats including paper and digital files. When arranging
hybrid records – whether representing original order, maintaining an
existing order, or otherwise establishing an arrangement – the archival
arrangement is pertinent to all holdings across all applicable
hierarchical levels and should be designated and expressed consistently
regardless of the format being arranged.</p>

<p>Description reflects arrangement, but the physical arrangement of the
items in a collection may or may not parallel the intellectual
arrangement. Items that are described together may be stored separately
because of their differing size, shape, condition, access or use
conditions, physical composition, format or other factors.</p>

<h3 id="arrangement">Arrangement</h3>

<h4 id="step-9---follow-arrangement-recommendations-in-project-vitals">Step 9 - Follow Arrangement Recommendations in Project Vitals</h4>

<h4 id="step-10---standard-arrangement">Step 10 - Standard Arrangement</h4>

<p>The most common and often the most appropriate arrangement action is to
leave things as they are. In such cases, the processing archivist
should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Maintain original order/as received</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conduct minimal physical arrangement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not undertake rearrangement of material within folders</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Whenever it exists, original order should be maintained.</strong> Original
order represents the creator’s structure, and reveals information about
the creator, the use of the records, and the relationship among and
between the files. However, in cases in which the original order is
indiscernible or untenable, introducing or establishing a workable
arrangement is an acceptable option. As stated in the Society of
American Archivists online glossary, “archivists are not required to
preserve ‘original chaos’ and may arrange such materials in a way that
facilitates their use and management without violation of any archival
principle.”</p>

<p>Often it may not be known if the existing arrangement comprises the
original order. In cases such as this, the processing archivist consider
retaining the existing order “as received”.</p>

<p>In addition to Original Order or “As Received”, common arrangement types
include: Type/Format; Activity/Function; Alphabetical; and Chronological
order.</p>

<p><em>Arrangement creates an intellectual and most often a physical structure
for a collection, with the objective of enabling accurate descriptions,
which lead to efficient access and management. Effective arrangement
opens collections to research as quickly as possible, but it is not a
tool used to create perfectly manicured collections. If assigned a
project which necessitates considering arrangement options, <strong>consult
the Head of Processing and receive his/her approval before proceeding to
alter the existing arrangement.</strong></em></p>

<h4 id="description"><em>Description</em></h4>

<p>Once an arrangement plan is chosen, archival description begins, and
this work continues through all phases of the project until completion.
As processing of a given collection concludes, the Processing Team
periodically takes further steps to evaluate, improve, and optimize the
description through editing and updating all collection guides as
necessary.</p>

<p>Description is the creation of an accurate representation of the
archival material by the process of capturing, collating, analyzing, and
organizing information that serves to identify archival material.
Description also explains the context and records systems that produced
the archival material, as well as the results of these processes.</p>

<p>The RAC has adopted the Society of American Archivists’ endorsed
<em>Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS)</em> to govern the archival
description of all RAC archival holdings, regardless of form, medium or
creator (individuals, families or corporate bodies). For details, please
refer to <a href="http://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS">http://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS</a>.</p>

<p>Archival description most often consists of a multi-level structure that
reflects the arrangement of the material, and the relationship between
those levels, beginning with a description of the whole and most often
continuing with description of the parts. It may consist only of a
description of the whole, but most often the description tends to be
more and more detailed with progression through the parts. Within a
given collection or project, and depending on the chosen processing
level, some parts may be described at greater or varying levels of
detail, with the resulting finding aid intentionally flexible in order
to produce a variety of descriptive outputs.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-finding-aid">Building the Finding Aid</h3>

<p>At RAC all archival description is recorded in our collections
management system (ArchivesSpace), and all completed processing projects
are displayed online through our collection guides website DIMES.</p>

<p>100% of our online guides conform to DACS single-level minimum
compliance. To ensure that the quality and completeness of our guides is
maintained, we take steps to comply with DACS as soon as the initial
draft finding aids are created.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The standard term “A Guide to the….” Is used to differentiate

    <p>Finding Aid Filing Title</p>

    <ul>
      <li>

<h3 id="create-inventory">Create Inventory</h3>

<h4 id="step-15---create-inventory-or-build-uponreviseconfirm-existing-inventory">Step 15 - Create Inventory, or Build Upon/Revise/Confirm Existing Inventory</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>At Processing Level 1, particularly during initial ingest and
accessioning, the minimum requirement is single-level general
description of contents, which can serve in lieu of an inventory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General description can be a summary statement describing the whole
such as:</p>

    <p>
<div class="docs-example">

Accession contains grant files, Board of Directors records, and
    subject files.

</div>
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General description of contents from an appraisal report, or from
documents provided by the donor/depositor, could also serve in lieu
of an inventory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ideally, the donor/depositor will provide RAC with an inventory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the inventory prepared by the donor/depositor adequately meets
basic processing requirements, no additional RAC-produced inventory
is required at accessioning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of Level 1 inventorying, file-level description
also can be utilized to generally describe the contents of an entire
file, often spanning multiple folders or multiple boxes, with
individual instances assigned for each box. For Example:</p>

    <p>
<div class="docs-example">

  <p>Title: Grants, A-D</p>

  <p>Instance 1: Box 1  
  <br />Instance 2: Box 2</p>

  <p>Title: Board of Directors</p>

  <p>Instance 1: Box 4  
  <br />Instance 2: Box 5</p>

  <p>Title: Subject Files</p>

  <p>Instance 1: Box 6</p>

</div>
</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The inventory/container list, at all levels of Processing, should focus
on FILE LEVEL description, with each archival object/inventory entry
comprised of four vital parts</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Title</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Date</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instance information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Associated notes</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Remember FILE LEVEL description does NOT equate to FOLDER LEVEL
description.</p>

<p>In multi-level description, always remember to focus on the level being
described (Collection, Record Group, Subgroup, Series, Subseries, File)
with the description reflecting the arrangement and the inherent
relationship among and between the records of each level.</p>

    <p>The Title for each file should answer the question – What is this
file? Or, what is the content of this file?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Example:</p>

        <p>
 <div class="docs-example">

 Title: Board of Directors Meeting Minutes

 </div>
 </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The File Title can be a Formal Title (supplied by the creator) or it
can be a Devised Title (created by the archivist during processing).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In multilevel descriptions the name segment, or a portion of the
name segment, may be inherited from a higher level of description
and may not need to be explicitly stated at lower levels.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A.  Titles should be brief, yet uniquely identify the material.</p>

<p>B.  Titles should not end with a period.</p>

<p>C.  When listing the contents of a file in an alphabetical run, list the
    letters actually found within the run, such as “A-Z”, or portion of
    the run, such as “C-Y”. If unaware of the specific letters
    represented, use “A-Z”.</p>

<p>D.  Use a comma when recording locations. For example: Cummings Lecture
    at the Educational Alliance, New York City</p>

<p>E.  All RAC finding aids should be written predominantly using the
    English language. When working with titles in languages other than
    English, use the original title when feasible. If the language in
    question uses a different alphabet, such as Russian, provide an
    English language description of the type of records housed in the
    file (if known) and include a language of materials note at the
    appropriate level to indicate the language used.</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<h4 id="recording-names-in-the-title-element"><em>Recording Names in the Title Element</em></h4>

<p><em>It is important to note that this section addresses NAMES USED IN THE
TITLE ELEMENT ONLY. If a name has been chosen for recording in the name
of creator element, an authority record, or as an access point, the form
of that name is established by approved sources and national standards,
such as the Library of Congress Authorities and the Library of Congress
Subject Headings.</em></p>

<p>A.  Record the name(s) of the person(s), family (families), or corporate
    body predominantly responsible for the creation, assembly,
    accumulation, and/or maintenance of the records. <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/3_title">(<strong>DACS 2.3.4</strong>)</a></p>

<p>B.  Record the name(s) in the form by which the creator(s) or
    collector(s) is generally known, and by using the natural language
    order of the English language (or the natural language order of the
    language of the person or corporate body’s country of residence)
    <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/3_title">(<strong>DACS 2.3.5</strong>).</a></p>

<p>
  <div class="docs-example">

  Example: Detlev W. Bronk


  </div>
  </p>

<p>In ordered lists, the Surname (often the name by which the creator is generally known) can be presented first.</p>

<p>
  <div class="docs-example">

  Example: Bronk, Detlev W.


  </div>
  </p>

<p>C.  Abbreviations are strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>When recording the name of an individual, family, or a corporate body, use the full name rather than an abbreviation. For example, Detlev W. Bronk should be used rather than DWB or DB. Use of abbreviations, instead of the full names, for a limited number of the most commonly found names in the RAC collections is acceptable (such as the abbreviation JDR Jr. for John D. Rockefeller Jr.). Use of abbreviations is also approved when an abbreviation is commonly known and used by the general public.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Example:</p>

    <p>
  <div class="docs-example">

  <p>NATO can be used rather than North Atlantic Treaty Organization</p>

  <p>FBI can be used rather than Federal Bureau of Investigation</p>

  </div>
  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>D.  Acronyms should be spelled out, with the full name followed by the
    acronym provided in parenthesis. This allows researchers to search
    for terms using the name or the acronym.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Example:</p>

    <p>
  <div class="docs-example">

  National Academy of Sciences (NAS)

  </div>
  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>E.  Titles recording multiple names should be written as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If three or fewer persons are credited with, or predominantly
responsible for, the creation of the materials as a whole, record
their names in direct order. <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/3_title">(<strong>DACS 2.3.7</strong>)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If more than three persons are responsible for the creation of the
materials, record the name of the individual who predominates.
<a href="https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/3_title">(<strong>DACS 2.3.8</strong>)</a> Optionally, include all the names of the persons
who are credited with or predominantly responsible for the creation
of the materials. <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/3_title">(<strong>DACS 2.3.9</strong>)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examples:</p>

    <p>
<div class="docs-example">

<p>John Smith and Al Jones</p>

<p>John Smith, Al Jones, and Paul Adams</p>

</div>
</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If 6 people are responsible for creating the materials and John Smith predominates, record John Smith as the title (or the names of all 6 people)</p>

<p>F.  If multiple files contain the same basic title, with varying added
    components, the components should be subdivided with a hyphen or
    colon to signify subordination.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Examples:</p>

    <p>
  <div class="docs-example">

  <p>Job Jackets - Maps for Trustees</p>

  <p>Job Jackets - Open House</p>

  </div>
  </p>

    <p>G.  Titles physically written or recorded on folders may be abbreviated
  or truncated. Corresponding finding aid description should follow
  all stated rules and guidelines.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="describing-dates"><em>Describing Dates</em></h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Answers the question – When is the content of this file created?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be a single date (like the date of a meeting), or a range of
inclusive dates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At RAC the date assigned is most often an inclusive date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Date should be expressed as year month day.</p>

    <p>
  <div class="docs-example">

  For example: 1982 April 5.

  </div>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When describing consecutive spans of years, record the full years:</p>

    <p>
  <div class="docs-example">

  1941-1944.

  </div>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When describing multiple non-consecutive dates, use a comma:</p>

    <p>
  <div class="docs-example">

  1941, 1953, 1962.

  </div>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Date ranges that encompass a combination of consecutive and
non-consecutive date spans should be recorded as: 1941-1944, 1953.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the material in the file is not dated, record it as “undated”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If file contents are differentiated by months rather than years,
record the dates as:</p>

    <p>
<div class="docs-example">

   <p>1915 January-May</p>

   <p>1915 June-December</p>

</div>

<h4 id="instance-information"><em>Instance Information</em></h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Instance information should answer the question – Where is the file?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The instance connects intellectual control with physical control of
the file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FILE LEVEL description does not directly equate to FOLDER LEVEL
description.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instance Information records the carrier or container. Most often
the container is a Box, Box/Folder. In some cases, it is used to
record the Reel/Frame of microforms, or the Unique ID (AV#) of an
audiovisual item.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The primary instance (most often a “Box”) is designated as a Top
Container. For assistance with Top Container creation see Head of
Processing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also records the instance type – most often “Mixed Materials”.
“Microform”, “Moving Image”, “Still Image” are also common types
used.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="associated-notes"><em>Associated Notes</em></h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Notes most often used at the FILE Level are the Conditions of Access
note, and the Physical Description note (which is used to answer the
question – What is this physically?).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here are a variety of examples of File Level Description –</p>

    <p>
  <div class="docs-example">

  <p>
  <br />Title: Board of Directors Meeting Minutes
  <br />Date: 1947
  <br />Instances: Box 1, Folder 1
  <br />Associated Notes: Only used when pertinent.
  </p>

  <p>
  <br />Title: Board of Directors Meeting Minutes
  <br />Date: 1948-1952
  <br />Instances: Box 1, Folders 1-5
  </p>

  <p>
  <br />Title: Board of Directors Meeting Minutes
  <br />Date: 1953 June-1954 July
  <br />Instance: Box 2

<p><em><strong>Selecting Storage Containers and Enclosures</strong></em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Select a box and folder size for documents based upon the dimensions
of the majority of those to be contained within an enclosure. Most
documents are up to 8 ½” in width and 11” in length, require a
letter-size folder and box; papers larger than this size and up to 8
½” in width and 14” in length, require a legal-size folder and box.
Box sizes may vary within a collection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not combine ‘unlike’ items in the same box.</p>

    <p>
<div class="docs-example">

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Documents with metallic items (medals).</p>

<p>Documents with leather items which may be subject to deterioration
(red rot) and bleed into the box.</p>

<p>Documents with liquid or powder in an envelope or container.</p>

</div>
</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Coordinate with Collections Management whenever the project necessitates
the use of non-standard containers — including but not limited to:
oversized or undersized flat boxes, clamshell boxes, index card boxes,
microform boxes, still image containers, newspaper-sized and textile
boxes, and flat files or tubes.</p>

<p>The Collections Management team can assist with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ordering, or confirmation of on-site availability, RAC-preferred containers.</p>

<h4 id="step-21---address-collection-concerns-and-preservation-issues-based-on-the-recommendations-of-collections-management">Step 21 - Address Collection Concerns and Preservation Issues based on the Recommendations of Collections Management.</h4>

<p>The <strong>Collection Concern</strong> form is currently located: <strong>S:\Inter-Office\Archival\Forms.</strong></p>

<p><em>Please consult with Collections Management to request a stabilization consult,</em> or if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Material is damaged, torn or shedding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Material has a particular odor or stickiness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An unusual pattern exists on paper or film.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edges of materials appear irregular or ragged and appear to have
been ‘chewed’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Material shows signs of active or dormant mold, mildew or water
damage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Mold and mildew are types of fungi which may appear as brown,
blue-black, or green irregularly-shaped spots. Mold will predominate
when environmental conditions exhibit fluctuations in temperature, high
humidity, moisture, and limited circulation. Mold often develops after
water damage has occurred. <em>When mold is discovered, it is crucial to
isolate any affected items to prevent further contamination. Please
take immediate action by referring any mold or mildew issues to
Collections Management.</em></p>

<p>Mold spores can easily spread. Do not attempt to remove mold with cloth.
Although mold is likely to be in its dormant stage when discovered, it
can be reactivated by compromising conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Conservation Treatment</strong></p>

<p>Conservation treatment of items often requires invasive procedures to
restore damaged and brittle paper including de-acidification,
fumigation, solvent treatments, polyester film encapsulation, and paper
strengthening. Such procedures require the expertise of an approved
conservator or an off-site conservation technician. If materials are
discovered that may benefit from or require conservation treatment,
please consult Collections Management.</p>

<h5 id="preservation-during-processing">Preservation During Processing</h5>

<p><strong>A. Metal Fasteners, Paperclips, and More</strong></p>

<p>The physical condition, the nature and complexity of the records, their
associated research value, and the level of scholarly use the records
will receive following archival processing differ from collection to
collection or project to project. Therefore, issues regarding the
handling and/or removal of fasteners are addressed in the project
vitals.</p>

<p>A.  Fasteners serve a useful function in maintaining and preserving the
    physical and intellectual connections between the attached
    materials.</p>

<p>B.  All fasteners have the potential to damage records, particularly
    metal (non-stainless steel) fasteners which are subject to rust.</p>

<p>C.  It is neither necessary nor feasible to remove all fasteners from
    all archival materials during processing.</p>

<p>D.  To ensure the long-term preservation of the archival materials, all
    rusty fasteners should be removed and replaced with plastic or
    stainless steel fasteners, regardless of the processing level of the
    project.</p>

<p>E.  Often spiral bindings and ring binders are removed during archival
    processing, if removal of the bindings can be accomplished without
    damaging the archival materials. Any valuable information from the
    cover of a binder should be retained by inserting a preservation
    photocopy of the cover in the appropriate location within the file.
    Once any applicable information is retained, original binders should
    be thrown away.</p>

<p><strong>B. Unfolding / Flattening</strong></p>

<p>A.  Folded items should be unfolded and flattened during processing,
    unless doing so will damage the materials.</p>

<p>B.  Consult with Collections Management if the act of unfolding or
    flattening presents a high risk of damage to the archival material.</p>

<p>C.  In many cases, legal-size folders and/or boxes will accommodate the
    unfolded item(s). Material larger than a legal-size folder should be
    should be addressed in accordance with the practices for oversized material. Extremely large flat item(s) may be relocated to a map/flat file. <a href="#rehouse-archival-materials">See Step 17</a>.</p>

<p>D.  If the present form of an original oversize item(s) holds no
    intrinsic value, a reduced-size photocopy of the item(s) can be made
    and retained in the file as replacement for the original(s).</p>

<p>E.  When unfolding an item, do NOT force its flattening or fold it
    against the crease, which can tear the fibers and weaken the paper.
    If an item will not lay open, lay it against a flat surface and
    carefully weigh it down with beanbags or other flat weights to
    encourage the folds to relax and straighten.</p>

<p>F.  Unfolded fragile material may be enclosed in Mylar to provide
    additional support to the records and/or exert a gentle flattening
    pressure on curling documents.</p>

<p><strong>C. Multiples</strong></p>

<p>A.  If multiple exact copies of reports or other records are found
    within a collection or folder, retain two copies. (Retention of more
    than two copies of any individual item is reserved only for items
    with great intrinsic or monetary value such as photographs or
    films). Shred excess copies.</p>

<p>B.  Copies of items with added research value, such as handwritten
    notations, comments, or revisions, are NOT considered exact copies,
    and should always be retained in the archival collection.</p>

<p>C.  Some collection agreements contain stipulations regarding permanent
    removal, destruction or final disposition of materials removed from
    the archival collection during processing. Please consult with the
    Head of Processing to determine the stipulations relevant to the
    assigned project.</p>

<p><strong>D. Preservation Photocopying</strong> <a href="#preservation-photocopying">(See Step 25)</a></p>

<h3 id="image-eligible-digital-media">Image Eligible Digital Media</h3>

<h4 id="step-22--image-eligible-digital-media-and-document-in-finding-aiddigital-media-log">Step 22 – Image Eligible Digital Media and document in Finding Aid/Digital Media Log</h4>

<p>Disk images are single files containing the complete content and structure representing a data storage medium or device. There are two primary types of images, forensic images and logical images. Forensic images perfectly replicate the structure and contents of a
storage device, and allow the viewing of deleted files and slackspace (i.e. the unused
space on a disk). Logical images do not include slackspace. In general, all physical
media is imaged forensically, and all digital materials received via electronic transfer
are imaged logically. Variations are considered on a case-by case basis.</p>

<p>Images for most removable media are created in-house, and the hardware used to create the images varies depending on the digital media type.</p>

<p>The processing archivist will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Receive training to develop the necessary proficiencies for each of the common
removable media types and sizes (floppy disks, optical discs, drives, etc.).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appraise and assess the eligibility of the item(s) for preservation in our digital
repository in accordance with RAC collecting policy, copyrights, privacy rights, or
any legal, or statutory requirements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inventory the item in the Digital Media Log.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the RAC standard workflows to virus check and image the eligible removable media.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Note the presence of the item and document the imaging process in the
  digital media log &amp; finding aid.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>In the Digital Media Log, the Processing Archivist should document:</p>

            <p>
<div class="docs-example">

  <p>the transfer method (disk image, rip tracks, copy files)</p>

  <p>the item's original carrier type.</p>

  <p>the year of transfer</p>

</div>
</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Using this data, the Digital Media Log will automatically generate    <br />
the following formatted statement:</p>

            <p>
<div class="docs-example">

  <p>“This item was **imaged** from a **CDROM** in **2017**”</p>

  <p>The **bold text** shown in the above example is interchangeable based upon the metadata collected.</p>

</div>
</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Insert the resulting formatted statement into a Processing Information Note in the finding aid.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe the resulting file(s), within originating context, in aggregate in the <br />
    finding aid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After imaging, submit the original digital media for disposal in accordance with RAC
    Collections Management procedure.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rights-and-restrictions">Rights and Restrictions</h3>

<p>Transparency in the dissemination of information is a critical element
of the archival profession. For RAC Processing, the creation of this
guide serves to document our policies, practices, and procedures. In the
eyes of our users, transparency of the archival collections most often
manifests itself through our Access and Use policies and the
professional manner in which we systematically carry out our practices.
RAC strives to inform users of all access and use conditions pertinent
to our collections; identify and describe all restricted materials; and
inform all users of what they can see and use, what they can’t see and
use, and why. Entire archival collections or components of collections
(record group, subgroup, series, subseries, box, folder, and item) may
be restricted from public access or use.</p>

<p><em>During RACcess registration, all users agree to the terms of access/use
of all RAC holdings.</em></p>

<p><em>If questions regarding restricted or potentially restricted materials
arise during processing, please consult with the Head of Processing.</em></p>

<h4 id="step-23---label-physical-folders-containing-restricted-material-in-accordance-with-rac-guidelines">Step 23 - Label Physical Folders Containing Restricted Material in Accordance with RAC Guidelines</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If all items in a folder are restricted, the folder is labeled
“Closed” or “Restricted”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all items in a folder or box are temporarily restricted, such as
by a time embargo, clearly state on the folder or box when the
material will be open.</p>

    <p>
    <div class="docs-example">
    Restricted – Open in 20XX
    </div>
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a portion of the contents of a box or folder is restricted, the
container is labeled “Closed Material Within”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Physically relocating restricted material to the end of a collection
or series/component is preferable (when viable), rather than having
restricted and open materials stored in the same box. This provides
RAC the opportunity to store the restricted material at an RAC
facility other than Hillcrest. Regardless of physical location, the
restricted material should always be described intellectually in the
appropriate place within the finding aid.</p>

<p><strong>A.  Common Types of Restricted Materials in RAC Collections</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Access Restrictions <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_4/1_conditions_governing_access">(DACS 4.1)</a></strong></p>

<p>This note is used to document archival materials whose access is
physically and/or intellectually restricted due to the nature of the
information documented.</p>

<p>A. Material restricted due to privacy rights, legal, or statutory
requirements.</p>

<p>Common types of records that fall into this category are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Personnel files (and/or personnel-like records)</em> are restricted to
ensure personal privacy and restrict access to materials generally
considered confidential between an individual and his or her
employer. Personnel records include: employment applications,
resumes/CVs, letters of appointment, personal references, salary or
withholding statements, performance evaluations, and other
correspondence discussing general or particular circumstances of an
individual’s employment or job performance. Personnel records also
often include personal injury and/or workers compensation insurance
records or claims and pension documents. Records gathered in the
course of conducting an executive search, or in filling a
professional position, may also be restricted. Please consult the
Head of Processing with any questions regarding the restriction of
personnel materials.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Financial records</em> – Access to a variety of financial records is
restricted in order to protect personal privacy and insure RAC
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Commonly
restricted financial materials include, but are not limited to:
state/federal income tax, property tax, payroll records, bank and
brokerage statements, and account information, etc. Access is
granted to some financial records, particularly those that are in
the public domain such as copies of IRS Form 990 titled “Return of
Organization Exempt From Income Tax.” This form provides the public
with financial information about a given non-profit organization and
is often the only public source of such information. Some collection
agreements also contain specific restriction stipulations regarding
financial materials. Please consult the Head of Processing with any
questions regarding the restriction of financial materials.</p>

    <p><em>Medical records/records that document the medical history of
individuals</em> - The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA) was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996. See
<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/">https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/</a>. In accordance with the stipulations of
HIPAA and other personal privacy regulations, access to the
following types of records are restricted: formal medical
examination forms, patient files or doctor’s notes on the condition
of a patient and/or his/her treatment, autopsy records, medical
histories, and correspondence regarding a specific individual’s
medical state. Additional restricted materials include but are not
limited to: medical insurance records or claims, personal injury,
workers compensation records or claims, any documentation from an
individual describing a medical situation (physical or mental
illness, surgery), or similar information about others (spouse’s or
child’s illnesses or sensitive circumstances surrounding their
death). The HIPAA regulations are broad and far reaching. When
processing or handling medical records please consult the Head of
Processing and act cautiously to restrict sensitive materials.</p>

    <p><em>Student records</em> - FERPA (the Family Education Right and Privacy
Act) restricts access to student records (e.g., health, grades,
disciplinary action, etc.) for the lifetime of the student. See
<a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html</a>. FERPA
protects student and parent rights to access their own student
records, stored and maintained by the school, and restricts access
to those records by others without the permission of the student or
parents.</p>

    <p>The Buckley Amendment to FERPA allows directory information to be made public without permission, including the student name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student. Please consult the Head of Processing with any questions regarding the restriction of student records.</p>

    <p><em>Peer Review</em> – Privacy and confidentiality of individuals involved in a
peer review process may necessitate a restriction on access to records. Often
found in faculty papers, peer review is a common practice for grant applications
and scholarly publications to evaluate the worthiness of grant recipients and
submissions to academic journals. These reviews are often submitted with an
expectation of confidentiality. Peer reviews are usually submitted on forms
provided by the academic journal/grant-giving institution, or submitted on
regular letterhead. (Depending on the collection, this may be stated as a
donor-imposed access restriction, or access may be granted with a restriction
placed on the use of the records.) Please consult the Head of Processing with
any questions pertaining to peer review records.</p>

<p>B. <em>Classified materials)</em> – Sensitive materials that are restricted due
to content pertaining to national security. (Further details are
provided later in this section regarding the identification and handling
protocol for classified materials.)</p>

<p>C. <em>Donation/Deposit Agreement-based access restrictions</em> (terms of the
collection agreement with which the RAC has agreed to abide and/or
subsequent relevant correspondence establishing such restrictions).</p>

<p>Each individual collection may have its own stipulations, so it is
essential to become familiar with all the terms of the agreement for the
specific collection pertinent to a given processing project. Consult
with the Head of Processing for copies of appropriate documents from the
collection files. The most common restrictions are:</p>

<p>1.  Date-based access – materials within a collection are often
    accessible to research following an agreed-upon embargo period (10
    years; 20 years). <em><strong>An entire file is restricted until the most
    recent date within that file has reached the end of the embargo.</strong></em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>With a 10-year embargo, a file dated 1992-2007 would be open in 2018.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a 20-year embargo, a file dated 1992-2007 would be open in 2028.</p>
  </li>

      </div>
  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2.  Access to archival material providing the names, correspondence,
    and/or activities of living Rockefeller family members, and the net
    worth of any Rockefeller family members, is restricted in all
    Rockefeller family collections.</p>

<p>Notable exceptions include documentation of a Rockefeller family member acting in an
official governmental capacity, and in situations in which the information in question is accessible through public sources such as newspapers.</p>

<p>
    <div class="docs-example">
    Examples: References to Jay Rockefeller when he served in an official capacity as
    governor and then as a senator for West Virginia. References to Nelson A. Rockefeller when he served as governor of New York or as Vice President of the United States.

  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An additional unpublished note should be added at the file-level

    </div>
  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.  Some collection agreements require the researcher to sign a RAC
    access and/or use permission form prior to conducting research.
    (Example: Population Council Accession 2).</p>

<p>4.  Some collection agreements require the researcher to acquire written
    or oral permission directly from the donor or depositor institution,
    or the RAC, prior to conducting their research.</p>

<p>5. Some collection agreements indicate that the archival material is
    closed pending processing. In this case, access/use is restricted
    until the collection is processed. The Head of Processing will
    designate the material “open” once the necessary work is completed.</p>

<p>D.  <em>Condition/Security-based access restrictions <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_4/2_physical_access"><strong>(DACS 4.2)</strong></a></em> - A fundamental objective of RAC is to facilitate the long-term preservation, conservation, and security of our archival holdings. At times the long-term care of individual items will take precedence over their availability for immediate access. Access to extremely valuable, fragile, brittle, unstable, or damaged items is restricted by RAC in order to protect these high-risk items from theft, damage, or further deterioration. (Example: JDR Sr’s Ledger A).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Examples of standard file-level access notes -</p>

</ul>

<p>E. <em>Technical access restrictions <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_4/3_technical_access"><strong>(DACS 4.3)</strong></a></em>  – Some archival
material is restricted due to its format or other special needs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Format – Access to certain formats may be completely or partially
restricted. Examples:</p>

    <p>
    <div class="docs-example">

    <p>Access to photographic negatives is restricted unless special
    permission is granted by RAC.</p>

    <p>Access to Paul Ehrlich copy books is restricted, and researchers are
    directed to typescript copies.</p>

    </div>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Re-formatted collections – Access to original archival materials is
restricted after a collection has been reformatted (microfilm,
microfiche, digital files). Researchers are only provided access to
the user copies of the reformatted media or digital files. (Example:
JDR Sr.’s Letterbooks, RF Officer’s Diaries).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special technical access issues may also necessitate restrictions on
access.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Example of standard access note for technical access restrictions:</p>

        <p>
    <div class="docs-example">
      Researchers interested in accessing digital media (floppy disks,
      CDs, DVDs, etc.) in this collection must use an access surrogate.
      The original items may not be accessed because of preservation
      concerns. To request an access surrogate be made, or if you are
      unsure if there is an access surrogate, please contact an archivist.
    </div>
  </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>2. Use Restrictions</strong></p>

<p>This note documents those materials whose use is completely restricted,
or limited in some manner, due to legal requirements, stipulations of a
donor/depositor agreement with RAC, or other factors imposed directly by
RAC after physical or intellectual access has been provided.</p>

<p>If the material being processed has use restrictions or stipulations,
such conditions will be identified, and a course of action will be
established through discussions with the Head of Processing during the
planning phase of the project.</p>

<h5 id="classified-material">Classified Material</h5>

<p>The RAC maintains U.S. government classified material that originated
from a number of its collections, including the Nelson A. Rockefeller
papers, the Rockefeller University archives, and the Warren Weaver
papers. The RAC does not currently maintain any classified digital or
born-digital records.</p>

<p><strong>1. Identifying Classified Materials</strong></p>

<p>Be particularly sensitive to discovering classified materials in a
collection that includes government documents and/or scientific research
which may contain sensitive materials pertaining to the national
security of the United States or other countries.</p>

<p>A.  Material stamped Confidential, Secret, Top Secret, Restricted,
    Restricted Data, or FRD (Formally Restricted Data).</p>

<p>B.  Be particularly sensitive to government documents from: Atomic
    Energy Commission, Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of
    Investigation, President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board
    (PFIAB), U.S. Department of the Army, U.S. Department of Defense,
    U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Department of the Navy, and U.S.
    Department of State.</p>

<p><strong>2. Protocol for Handling Classified Materials</strong></p>

<p>A.  The RAC follows CIA-approved procedures for handling and storage of
    classified records by qualified RAC archivists with security
    clearance at the SECRET level.</p>

<p>B.  Upon discovery of classified material, or potentially classified
    material, in a collection, the processing archivist should
    immediately alert the Head of Processing. The qualified archivist
    will then remove the pertinent material from the body of the
    collection and secure it in the RAC Classified safes, along with a
    brief inventory.</p>

<p>C.  The qualified archivist then follows the established practice of
    periodically requesting review for declassification of these records
    by the relevant federal agencies. Recent reviews have been conducted
    by the CIA, the U.S. Army, the NSA, the Department of Defense, and
    the Department of Energy.</p>

<p>D.  No RAC staff members are authorized to handle material designated as
    TOP SECRET or higher. However, the secret-level qualified archivist
    should immediately secure the materials in the RAC classified safe.
    An applicable government official must be contacted to address this
    material further.</p>

<p>E.  Sometimes material in a collection has been declassified. In such
    instances, please be aware that even if all of the documents in a
    given section have been declassified, every individual page may not
    have been specifically marked as such. Depending on the situation,
    the declassified material can either be integrated back into the
    main body of the collection, or it may be placed as a separate group
    of files at or near the end of a collection.</p>

<h3 id="preservation-photocopying">Preservation Photocopying</h3>

<h4 id="step-25---preservation-photocopying-optional">Step 25 - Preservation Photocopying (Optional)</h4>

<p>Documents that are fragile, damaged, or at risk for further
deterioration may be photocopied in order to preserve their
intellectual content and prevent potential damage to neighboring
documents. A preservation photocopy is a facsimile of a document copied
to acid-free, lignin-free paper. <em>It is neither necessary nor feasible
to photocopy all fragile or potentially at risk materials during
processing and preservation photocopying is an optional task. Utilize
processing time effectively in accordance with assigned priorities and project
deadlines.</em></p>

<p>Acid-free, lignin-free paper consists of 25% cotton rag content; this
paper is distinguished from 20lb. bond paper used for routine
photocopying by its composition and the placement of a ‘watermark’. This
mark is visible most clearly when the paper is held up to a light
source. <em>A preservation photocopy must bear a stamp applied by the
archivist noting ‘Archival Copy’</em> in order to distinguish the copy as a
facsimile.</p>

<p>If the item bears no intrinsic value, the facsimile serves to replace
the original in the collection, and the original item is
discarded/shredded. <em>All materials proposed for shredding must follow
the RAC destruction protocol, <a href="#step-39---submit-any-materials-proposed-for-shredding-to-head-of-processing">see Step 39.</a></em> If the item is of value in its original format, consult with the Head of Processing regarding its retention. When an original is retained with restricted access, a
condition of access note should be added at the appropriate level of
description to indicate that the material is “restricted due to
preservation concerns”. <em>Note: A preservation photocopy is a ‘gray tone’ image;
a color copy of a document may accurately duplicate tonal qualities however
color is not a preservation-standard representation. It is essential to retain
established order when removing documents from a collection or folder
for photocopying. Carefully mark the item location(s), and after
copying, replace the item(s) in the original order.</em></p>

<p>Most archival material may be accurately duplicated using in-house
photocopy machines. It is important to generate as accurate a facsimile
as possible in order to replicate the original item. Correspondence,
manuscripts, photographs and line drawings may be duplicated by
adjusting the settings on the photocopy machine. Check that the copy
toner adheres to the paper with no smudge or other excess markings.</p>

<p>Additional examples of materials that are routinely replaced by
preservation photocopies include: deteriorated newspaper clippings,
thermo fax and other glossy copy paper, telegrams, and items that are
glued or otherwise damaged by adhesives. For recommendations on how best
to photocopy non-standard or damaged materials, see the Head of
Processing.</p>
