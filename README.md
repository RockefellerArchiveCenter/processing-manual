# The Rockefeller Archive Center Processing Manual

The Rockefeller Archive Center Processing Manual provides detailed documentation on the archival processing methods used at the RAC. It was written by the RAC Processing Team.

## Accessing the Manual
The `master` branch of this repository contains the full Processing Manual divided into three sections based on content and is structured using Markdown:

* [About](mkdocs/docs/about.md) - the mission of the Processing Team and information about RAC processing methods.
* [Planning](mkdocs/docs/planning.md) - instructions on how to get started on a new processing project.
* [Processing](mkdocs/docs/processing.md) - provides step-by-step instructions for processing archival collections at the RAC.

The `gh-pages` branch contains a site built using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). The site presents the Processing Manual in a searchable web interface, and can be accessed at https://rockefellerarchivecenter.github.io/processing_manual/.
